##### What the fudge!?!

The iCloud payment journey is missing the “double tap” home button to confirm. In this case I was simply investigating *what the "Buy" button tap* would do. I did not expect it to buy and buy it immediately. Yet because my face was ever present, I was immediately charged. 

This is just wrong. A very bad and inconsistent UX. 

It is at best neglectful, at worse uncaring. Sure it was just £0.69. It could have been £25 or £199. 

It's these situations that I really feel that Apple is letting us (and themselves) down.
