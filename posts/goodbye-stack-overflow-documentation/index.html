So we went back to the drawing board and started another round of user interviews focused on Transact SQL. We brought on a user experience researcher to help us interview technical writers. The results were encouraging in the sense that we know a lot more about what makes for great documentation and how we might support that effort. But it was also clear fixing Documentation would require a significantly larger team.</p><p>&gt;In addition, itâ€™ll be a very long time before that work will pay off in terms of bringing new users to Stack Overflow. Our interviews showed even very experienced users of T-SQL felt inadequate to contribute documentation.</p><blockquote><p>...</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Finally, our research showed that while a lot of developers were dissatisfied, the current state of <strong>programming documentation is not universally broken the way Q&amp;A</strong> was when Stack Overflow started. In particular, we heard over and over that Stack Overflow has become de facto documentation for many technologies.</p></blockquote><p>While I'm a little sad by this news (I had previously <a href="http://ajmccall.com/documentation-stackexchange/">written</a> about this project) I believe that Stack Overflow Documentation demise documents one last great lesson in tech. <em>How and when to abandon a project.</em></p><p>No matter the <s>good</s> great intentions, some projects you are working on are just not working. It's important to identify them <em>early</em>, identify viable improvements to make and test the changes. If the project is still dying, either pivot or abandon it.</p><p>And we all know which one is the hardest decision to make.</p><p>&gt;Even though this outcome has been a disappointment, most of us agree it was the right decision.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span></article></div></body></html>
