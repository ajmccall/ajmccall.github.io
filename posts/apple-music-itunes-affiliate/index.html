Older style urls, ones without this parameter now open Apple Music by default.</p><p>Oh very sneaky Apple. We see what you did there.</p><p>Our app <a href="http://mtvtrax.com">MTV Trax</a> allows users to buy any track they would like to keep. And for a few months, our buy buttons would direct our lovely users to a competing service. <em>To a competing service!</em></p><p>Very sneaky.</p><p>The changes were documented <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/blog/apple-music-is-now-live-1.html">here</a> although I'm not sure how well it was publicised.</p><p>If you are picky about where your users go after tapping on a buy link, you might want to reexamine your links.</p><p>######Example</p><p>For instance</p><p><code>https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cool-for-the-summer-single/id1013069897?app=music</code></p><p>will take your user to Apple Music where they can stream the song, while</p><p><code>https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cool-for-the-summer-single/id1013069897?app=itunes</code></p><p>takes you to the iTunes Store where you can buy the song.</p><p>######How much do I earn?</p><p>In both cases you'll still be paid by Apple for sending users their way, although even here it has change.</p><p>For iTunes redirects, an affiliate member earns 7% of any sales within 24hrs on iTunes.</p><p>For Apple Music redirects, an affiliate member earns a one-off <em>$5</em> fee, if the user purchases/renews their subscription.</p><p>Back of the envelope calculates suggest that if your user spends more than <em>$70</em> on iTunes you are better off sending them to iTunes.</p><p>######Summary</p><p>It seems like a no brainer to always redirect to iTunes.</p><p>For one, iTunes redirects always earn commission unlike the Apple Music one-off payment. An iTunes redirect commission is also paid on <em>all</em> purchases made, not just the item you linked to. Movies, TV shows, books and games are included.</p><p>Lastly, you only get paid by Apple if, and that's a big <em>if</em>, the user subscribes at the end of their trial.</p><p>My advise?</p><p>Don't feed the Apple Music monster.</p><p>Send your users to iTunes and receive a little more cash in return.</p><p>#####Further reading</p><ul><li><a href="http://awkwardhare.com/post/117029547150/use-the-itunes-affiliate-program-its-worth-it">Why it's worth it to join the affiliate program</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/">iTunes Affiliate Program</a></li></ul></div><span>Tagged with: </span></article></div></body></html>
